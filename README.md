### TODO
- Find and deal with all TODO's in code
- Function for getting all sharesies API data (either to live locally or be deployed to AWS lambda)
- Determine scope - run project locally or host
	- if not hosting this website, write local function/script to get sharesies data and store file locally to be used
	- if hosted then move sharesies API interactions to lambda
	- will also need to implement a login screen? Or input an API cookie to be used in lambda?
- Crypto.com API socket implementation
